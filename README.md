## Notes

- [k8s post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-kubernetes-in-under-3-hours-a-detailed-guide-to-orchestrating-containers-114ff420e882/)
- k8s is a disaster for p2p protocols, it is a very bad match. Great for monolithic microservice stacks, not much else.
- kubeadm@1.12.3 support upper limit is 18.06: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/3323
